<h1 style="padding-top:30px; padding-left:30px; color: 00008B;"> WHAT IS OUR CHANNEL EVEN ABOUT</h1>
<p style="color:00008B;" class="sukuna" > Our Youtube Channel will mostly revolve around showcasing ideas and concepts that can help the many problems in the world; such as our musical/concert to help the needy in Sitio Bebe. <br><br>Our Videos will fall under entertainment and education, because we want to tell people what is really happening in the world. We also thought that instead of delivering it as a cold hard video, we would show people our ideas with magic and whimsy in it; by referencing and mimicking trends; not to the point the original message gets distorted, of course! </p>

<h1 style="padding-top:30px; padding-left:30px; color:  00008B;font-family: tahoma,Helvetica;"> WHO IS OUR TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
<p class="sukuna"> We decided that our target audience will be in the range between the ages of 16-24 years old; because of how many people within the target age group tend to interact more online compared to other age groups.
We also believe anybody of any gender identity can thoroughly enjoy our content. Students and workers can watch to pass the time at home or at lunch and maybe even learn a thing or two about the world.

<h1 style="padding-top:30px; padding-left:30px; color:  00008B;font-family: tahoma,Helvetica;"> WHAT WE NEED TO BE A PART OF OUR SYMPHONY</h1>
<p class="sukuna"> Here are some of the things we need to hold tight and not let go; to finally help realize our Youtube idea.<br><br>We would need a creative production team (Our Members) to ideate and create content to post on our youtube channel, good editing software (Such as Capcut and/or Adobe) A good place to record the video and a good host. <br><br> A good post schedule and multiple stock ideas would be best for our Youtube channel, as lack of content can make an audience hungry. Having multiple stock ideas ensures that when ideas for content run dry, we can resort to executing our backup ideas.<br><br> It would also be nice to have a hawk, to alleviate stress. (make people happy.) </p>
